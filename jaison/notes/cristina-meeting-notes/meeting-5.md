# Understand EXACTLY how SpeedyMurmurs simulator works
- Get familiar with SpeedyMurmurs
- Topologies
- Other algos supported (which ones?).
- How are they evaluating & plotting results

# Work with simulator
- See what algorithms are there
- Try out atleast half of them - the popular ones.
- Vary parameters for experiments - how to run & measure results
* Algo
* Topology
* Work Load
- Validate SpeedyMurmurs evaluation results on their simulator & record results
- Write down settings for each experiment - maintain a list of what you run.
- Format for filenames. Self explanatory filenames.
- Write down metrics, what we measure in an experiment - not in words - mathematical formula - average then mention average and if one time then one-time.

- Note down results on Gitlab
- Commit all work on Gitlab

# Research
- Check out SpeedyMurmurs algo and figure out what a malicious node can do and what impact that it can have
- Pick one algo between Ben and I and learn it inside out.
- Breaking anonymity in TOR/SpeedyMurmurs type systems - network related anonymity - what are their assumptions - what can break? - wrong deployment can cause issues.

- Add to Interledger and Stream IRC(?) - Twitter
