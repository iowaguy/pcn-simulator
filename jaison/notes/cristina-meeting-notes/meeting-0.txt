- NSDI
- UseNix ATC

Networking:
- SIGCOMM
- CONEXT

Distributed Systems *Not really first tier*:
- ICDCS
- DSN

How to select papers:
- Citations - for fundamental topics
- Find papers published in these conferences, if not, ask Cristina
- Authors who have published good papers, keep in mind good authors
- Famous schools

Not more than one month on getting done with these sessions:

3 Sessions: 1 Month!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Session 1: ROUTING Fundamentals:
* Read Radia Permans Thesis + PITNS together - PITNS is more complete. (routing between any two pairs) - code publicly available.
* ODSBR - routing between 1 source and destination *not entire network*, does not deal with byzantine intrusion, it does find where the attackers are aka Fault localisation.

- Read these three together.
- Note how long it takes to read the paper.
- Try figure out things with Ben. If not, ask Cristina.

- Figure out what is done, what isnt, advantages.
- Write ideas that come to mind after reading these.
**Note: These will not be credit based.


Session 2: Privacy:
- TOR paper
- Recent attacks against TOR.
- Nikita Borisov's website is good, Amir H*something* - look at them and find papers that are recent.
- Ian Goldberg.
- Cristinas slides on anonymity. Talks about things before TOR. Mixnets, statistical attacks.

Session 3: Credit Based Networks:
- In the credit based networks, citation, read all the ones that are cited in the abstract.




How to read?
- Be skeptical about everything you read.
- What they did and what they did not do
- Try finding Limitations
Think: "They did x and did not do Y, what assumptions did they make? what models they did use?"

Be able to summarise papers:
- What is the problem?
- Model
- Assumption
- What is the solution?
- How are you convinced that the solution is good?
- Evaluation: is it realistic?
- Proofs: if it is security*
