# Things to try:
- Search: Are there data sets? Other credit networks that people have, which have their own data sets. Use this for what you have.
- What type of attacks can be simulated (from what you've read until now) on this and how?
	- How will you simulate an attack? You need to define attacker model and change the data set accordingly (if needed)
	- What will happen if I randomly take off a few transactions or have duplicates? What do speedy murmurs and silent whispers do when they get transactions that dont make sense?
	- Attack on privacy/anonymity: go through previous papers and figure out how to simulate.
	- What is the attacker model they assume? Note down assumptions. Try simulating their attacker model.
	- What if an attacker DOES NOT split the transactions. What can you do to deviate from the graphs shown.
	- Can you make rare things happen more frequently? What is the cost of the attack?
	- Think about something visual to show when presenting.


- Look at Spider Network, it improves over these.
- Come up with list of attacks and try them out. To demonstrate.
