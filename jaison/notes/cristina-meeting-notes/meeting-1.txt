Other Ideas:
-----------
- Explore QUIC? HTTP/3 to be based on QUIC.
- Autonomous vehicles and byzantine detection/protection to such systems.


Cristina's Feedback:
-------------------

Try to understand the differences between the system models for all three.
Routing layer(ip layer) different from routing.
Both ODSBR and Radia's thesis are solving Byzantine routing at the ip level

- Routing Algorithm - howre they different?
- Classify algorithm - on demand, reactive routing

- Classes of routing protocol and difference between them. Google this! Proactive and on-demand.
- Radia's - proactive algorithm - routing tables are proactively maintained. RIP.

- Intrusion tolerant - different type of routing - application level
* provides reliability
* Priority


Nothing in ODSBR which is wireless specific. Radia took this and re-wrote for on-wire.

After you understand the system and the goals. How are the services these systems provide have value without security?

And finally move to the attacker model. Two step process, whats been stated when problem is described and what really happens.

All protocols always have a control plane and data plane.
- Is it protecting the control messages or data itself?
- Read to look for control plane and data plane.
* ODSBR -  control plane is route discovery.
* Proactive - link updates. open system
* PITNS - Had a closed universe. It is not open.

What type of data?
PITNS - design of system is to work inspite of byzantine nodes
ODSBR - works on detection.


Before you read, have an intension to understand.
- Problem, model, solution.

What does the node know about the rest of the network
- RIP is DSDV implementation only knows neighbors.
- In PITNS each node knows all the nodes in the universe.


Go through introduction to cryptography and read HMACS and Digital Signature.

When reading more than one paper on the same topic, compare them.
- Read for idea and how does it fit with what I've read. I don't read for details.


Security problems: what are they securing, unless its crypto.
Not too many people will be upfront about if the attacker knows the solution or not.

Summary:
- Understand difference in system model and solution.
- How it fits with credit payments networks. Does it fit here?
