Three parts to the systems PCN
- Routing
- Transaction
- Accountability

Attack:
- DOS cannot be easily detected.
- Join and leave repeatedly; create instability

Privacy:
- Counter Raptor
- If TCP is used, that is not encrypted

Silent Whispers:
- What happens if clocks are not synchronised; synchronicity of clocks is an assumption made.

Think about the metrics mentioned (SM - Pg 6) and can you attack those.
Hop Delay - delaying payments (Pyramid scheme)

When thinking of an attack, think of metric that gets impacted.

Think % when thinking numbers (10% byzantine)

avg all attacks with atleast 10 runs.


Find at what point the system breaks.
Measure how long it takes you to run one round of entire data set.
