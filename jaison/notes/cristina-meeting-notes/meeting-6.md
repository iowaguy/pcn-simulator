- Start with the most obvious plot from paper and try reproducing it (fig 2.a,b,c).
- For each plot what are the relevant data files used. Try out some values.

- 20 Ripple data set.
- Pick the 2.a,b and c and figure out how they're made.
- Unit for each plot.

- How to plot a single point in that graph provided the output files from the simulator.
- What do they assume about the network?
- What are the parameters for the run?
    - Nodes
    - Landmarks
    - **what else**
- Who is reporting that the transaction is successful? Sender/intermedia/receiver?

**Hint:** Run a simulation with a small data set - a few dozen transactions maybe?
