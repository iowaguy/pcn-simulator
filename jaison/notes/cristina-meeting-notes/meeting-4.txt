Routing:
- IP based
- Geographical

Homomomorphic based cryptography - allows operations on encrypted data.

Virtual cooridinates(Vivaldi).
- based on latency - decentralised - based on pings.

Read a book on Cryptography.


- Protocol stack design: scalanility, accessiblit, adoption
- Crypto:


Only advantage QUIC has over TCP:
- Encrypts headers.


- Congestion control in TOR.

# READ - gives you some idea of the different types of routing - geographic based.
- Vivaldi virtual co-ordinates
- Beacon

- Learn how to evaluate systems.

- Come up with 3 things you want to do. Routing, anonymity, security: Talk with others and bounce off ideas.



- Systems and evaluation.
- See whatever is implemented and how theyve done it.
- How do people evaluate and deploy the system.
- What code is available and where you can start with.
- Ask ASAD and connor about Red Belly evaluation system. ODSBR has good evaluation of systems under attack.
* shows you how and what to quantify.

- Understand paper submitted with Antony.

- Good thesis HAS to be a paper!!!

- Meet 1st day after Spring break.
