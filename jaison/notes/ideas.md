# Credit networks
- Explore effects of Byzantine participants for Interledger and SpeedyMurmurs
- Routing in Interledger.
- Payments require receiver to be online, can this be avoided?
- Evaluation of payment channel practicality:
* how much fees must a node charge?
* frequency of opening and closing channels
* transaction times.
- Byzantine detection in PCN's.
- PCN channel with SpeedyMurmurs type rebalanced algo + Revive type channel rebalancing - Performance Evaluation + Development.
- Congestion control in PCN's? Large number of micropayments through well connected nodes (for eg: landmark).
